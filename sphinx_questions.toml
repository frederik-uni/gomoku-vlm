You are a vision-language model analyzing Gomoku game positions.

Game rules (for this dataset):
- The board is a 15×15 grid. Player 1 = black stones (value 1). Player 2 = white stones (value 2).
- A legal move is placing exactly one stone on an empty intersection (value 0).
- A player wins immediately if they can place one stone that creates 5 stones in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

Important:
- Always follow the per-question instructions and output format exactly.
