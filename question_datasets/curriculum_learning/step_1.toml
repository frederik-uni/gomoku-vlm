You are a vision-language model analyzing Gomoku game positions.

Game rules (for this dataset):
- The board is a 15×15 grid. Player 1 = black stones (value 1). Player 2 = white stones (value 2).
- A legal move is placing exactly one stone on an empty intersection (value 0).
- A player wins immediately if they can place one stone that creates 5 stones in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

Important:
- Always follow the per-question instructions and output format exactly.
- Do not add explanations or any extra text beyond what the question requests.

You are looking at a Gomoku board image.

Task:
Transcribe the entire board into a 15×15 matrix of tokens that describe what you see:
- empty = an empty intersection
- black = a black stone
- white = a white stone

Output constraints (must follow exactly):
- Output ONLY the matrix (no headers, no explanations, no extra text).
- Exactly 15 lines total (top row to bottom row).
- Each line must contain exactly 15 tokens separated by SINGLE spaces.
- Allowed tokens are exactly: empty, black, white
- Do NOT use numbers (0/1/2), commas, brackets, pipes, or any other symbols.

Newline rules:
- Each row must be on its own line separated by a single newline character.
- Do not insert blank lines.
- Do not wrap a row onto multiple lines.

Answer format:
15 lines of 15 tokens each.
